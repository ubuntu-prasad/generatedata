[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/benkeen/generatedata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/benkeen/generatedata)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/benkeen/generatedata/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/benkeen/generatedata?branch=master)

This is the repo for the downloadable version of [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com). The 
script is essentially an *engine* to generate any sort of random data in any format. It currently comes with 30 or 
so *Data Types* (types of data it generates), 8 *Export Types* (formats for the data), plus around 30 data sets for specific countries (city names, regions etc). But more importantly it can be extended in any way you want. Check out the [developer documentation](http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/developer.html)
for more information on that. If you need to generate random data programmatically rather than manually via the UI, you can use the [REST API](http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/api.html).

The master branch now contains the incomplete v4 rewrite, so if you're downloading the script, get the most recent 
tag: https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/releases

*This README file still contains information about the v3 code. It will stay that way until v4 is in alpha stage.*

## Requirements
- PHP 5.3 or any later version of PHP 5.
- MySQL 4.1.3 or later

## How to Install / Documentation

For installation instructions, user and developer documentation, check out:
http://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/

Installation is really, really simple. I deliberately wrote the script to be as self-contained as possible and not 
require additional PHP/Server configuration when setting it up. That said, it *does* require PHP 5.3.0 or later. See 
the documentation for more info.

## `master` = v4 rewrite

The master branch of this repo now contains the ongoing work for the v4 rewrite, temporarily found here:
http://generatedata4.com

The generatedata.com site, the documentation and everything else is for up to the v3 branch. You can find that code in the `v3` branch. 

Although I'm no longer working on that branch, PRs and bug fixes are very welcome! Just branch off `v3` and put 
your PRs in against that.

v4 is dropping PHP and MySQL and re-writing the entire script in node. This script will eventually become available as a node package which you can use in your own packages to generate your own code programmatically, but it will continue to offer the REST API and UI for constructing and generating the data sets.
